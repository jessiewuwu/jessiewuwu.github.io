    <h1>Enumerables: .each vs .map vs. .map! </h1>
    <p class="date">Saturday, November 22, 2014</p>
    <!--
      I. Intro - what is enumerable?
      II. .each - nothing happens to the array
      III. .map - it returns the new object with changes but doesn't change the array because there is a copy
      IV. .map! - it prints and modifies the original array
      V. conclusion -->

      <h3>Quick Intro to Enumberables</h3>
      <p>According to Ruby-doc (my favorite reference source.......):</p>
      <p class="codetext"> The Enumerable mixin provides collection classes with several traversal and searching methods, and with the ability to sort.</p>
      <p>Wut. Basically, enumberables allow us to take elements from collections (arrays, hashes, etc) one at a time. We can do certain things to each one of them. Depending on what we do, we may have new results or the same old original results. </p>
      <p>Let's use these three enumerators to illustrate how enumberable methods work: <span class="courier">.each</span>, <span class="courier">.map</span>, and <span class="courier">.map!</span>, along with an array called <span class="courier">not_fun</span>. Inside not_fun are three activities, <em>strings</em> to be exact.</p>
      <p class="codetext"> &gt; not_fun = ["washing dishes", "dieting", "doing paperwork"] <br>
        => ["washing dishes", "dieting", "doing paperwork"]</p>


      <h3>.each </h3>
      <p><span class="courier">.each</span> method allows you to go through the block of code for each element (in this case, our activity strings) of the array, but it returns the original object (the <span class="courier">no_fun</span> array).</p>
      <p class="codetext"> &gt; not_fun.each {|activity| activity.capitalize + " is so fun...not."} <br>
        => ["washing dishes", "dieting", "doing paperwork"]</p>
      <p>With <span class="courier">.each</span>, we capitalize each activity and form a sentence. However, you will see that it returned the original array without capitalization or the rest of the sentence. The reason why is <span class="courier">.each</span> doesn't modify the array. Also you don't see "Washing dishes is so fun...not" because we didn't put <span class="courier">puts</span> in the block of code. But don't worry about that because <span class="courier">puts</span>,<span class="courier"> return</span>, <span class="courier"> p</span>, and <span class="courier">print</span>s are a whole different beast to mess with.</p>

      <h3>.map</h3>
      <p><span class="courier">.map</span> method returns the new object with changes but it doesn't change the original array. Basically it's kind of like this kid using a protector sheet to draw over the original worksheet with a whiteboard marker.</p>
      <center><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GE4fDC_uLR4/U2B2W6v5ZYI/AAAAAAAAFfk/OVYOcQkHDTs/s1600/Parallel+Line+Drawings+%2810%29.jpg" width="400px" /></center>
      <p>However, in the end you can still pull the original worksheet from the protector sheet and it's as if his chubby crooked-line-drawing hands never touched it. Or something, kind of like that.... let's see with actual Ruby.</p>
      <p class="codetext"> &gt; not_fun.map {|activity| activity.capitalize + " is so fun...not."} <br>
      => ["Washing dishes is so fun...not.", "Dieting is so fun...not.", "Doing paperwork is so fun...not."] </p>
      <p>Here you see that with <span class="courier">.map</span>, it returns a modified array where the activity is capitalized and in a complete sentence for each activity. However, if you run the array again, you will see it returned the original array without capitalization and sentence:</p>
      <p class="codetext">&gt; not_fun
      <br>=> ["washing dishes", "dieting", "doing paperwork"]</p>

      <h3>.map!</h3>
      <p><span class="courier">.map!</span> has an ! attached to it, making it a "destructive" version of <span class="courier">.map</span>. Destructive means it will modify and replace the original object with the changes done to each element.
      <p class="codetext"> &gt; not_fun.map! {|activity| activity.capitalize + " is so fun...not."} <br>
            => ["Washing dishes is so fun...not.", "Dieting is so fun...not.", "Doing paperwork is so fun...not."] </p>
      <p>When you run the <span class="courier">not_fun</span> array, you will see it has changed into a new array:</p>
      <p class="codetext"> &gt; not_fun <br>
        => ["Washing dishes is so fun...not.", "Dieting is so fun...not.", "Doing paperwork is so fun...not."] </p>

      <h3>...and there you have it! </h3>
