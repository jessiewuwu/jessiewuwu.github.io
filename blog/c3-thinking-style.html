    <h1>My Thinking Style and Learning</h1>
    <p class="date">Sunday, November 16, 2014</p>

    <h3>Thinking Style</h3>
    <p class="codetext"> Concrete Sequential Thinkers tend to be based in reality. They process information in an ordered, sequential, linear way.</p>
    <p>This is what I got for the personal thinking style quiz. Even though I took this quiz three weeks ago, it wasn't until this week I realized that is true - the most effective learning style for me is learning on my own at my own pace and then working with others. I always thought I was better learning on my own - after all I passed all my classes on my own because I ditched so much in college - because it is hard for me to articulate my thought process and to explain clearly. So in college, I typically avoided voluntary group assignments and study groups. However, this week I learned so much talking to Amadou in one hour compared to the first half of the week. Man, that man is a great teacher. It also helped working with Andrew side-by-side (he's my neigbor and good friend irl!) that I learned more as I explained things to him.</p>
    <p>The one thing I really need is structure. Without structure, I feel lost and overwhelmed. When I solve problems, I tried to see if there is a pattern in structure. I think it's from taking so many calculus math classes (why the hell am I not better at this then?!).</p>

    <h3>Fixed Mindset - Struggling &amp; Giving Up</h3>
    <p>Man, this week was tough. I gave up and restarted on challenges, exercises, and ultimately on myself at one point. Last night to be exact, after the Pretty Triangle exercise in Challenge 5, around 9:30pm. I couldn't believe how much I was struggling with what seemed like a relatively simple iteration (or is reclursion?! I don't know!) problem. My worries started snowballing until it became this emotional avalanche. I was so worried that if I couldn't even get the basics of Ruby, how the hell am I going to succeed in DBC, next week's Ruby challenges that build on this week's basics, as a developer?  </p>

    <h3>Growth Mindset - Struggling is Learning </h3>
    <p>Today I realized that it is okay, I am still learning everything. I also realized just because I am terrible with the control flow problems, it doesn't mean I don't understand other things in Ruby. I mean yeah it sucks that I don't know as much as other students and that I may be struggling more than most of them, but I am making progress, little by little. I am trying, which is way better than me not trying/caring during high school and college. I am utilizing Office Hours, soliciting help from other Squirrels, and using different resources like Treehouse video tutorials. I use up every free minute to study, including washing dishes while watching Treehouse videos. Also, it feels so good to successfully go over a hurdle. </p>

    <h3>Fixed Mindset - Comparing Myself to Others</h3>
    <p>My intial anxiety rode off of comparing my solutions to my fellow peers'. Why was mine so long-winded and overly complicated? Why did mine have blocks of commented notes, used to help guide my approach and keep me on track and for everyone else, their solution was straightforward and on point? So the more I compared myself, the more frustrated I got, the more I wanted to give up. By 10pm, I was looking up other options outside of DBC because I was so freaked out about the looming possbility of failure. </p>

    <h3>Growth Mindset - Different Approaches, Different Styles </h3>
    <p>I woke up with some clarity this morning, until I did my tutoring session. I was so overwhelmed and couldn't process anything the DBC Tutor was saying. However, after the tutoring session, I looked over the problem again and jumped into Office Hours, and this time with a different DBC person, I was able to understand the exercise. I knew the right questions to ask and finally felt in control. What I learned today is there are different approaches to the same problem and sometimes the way I learn is more compatible with the way someone else teaches. </p>

    <p>Let's see how Week 4 goes. I am worried, but I think at this point, I need to just get used to it, celebrate small victories, and SUCK IT UP!</p>
