  <p>Remember this photo? I didn't know it at the time but that cat was destined to be my favorite out of the seven cats living with your parents. I can't remember
     its name for the life of me, but there you are in the edge of the photo,
  <br />suspicious
  <br />curious
  <br />puzzled
  <br />peering around the corner to see what that howling noise was coming from.

  <p>For your birthday, I give you more reason to peer once again, my friend.</p>
